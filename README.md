# PHONE ACTIVATION - CLEANNING, ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION

My first ever data science project and honestly the one I'm most proud of.

This project consists of:
- Thoroughly cleaning the dataset from column names to the spelling of values
- Filling in missing values through the usage of correlation matrices and the groupby function, carefully studying the patterns and relations between each and every columm
- Predicting using machine learning algorithms and evaluating their accuracy scores through measurements and visualizations.
